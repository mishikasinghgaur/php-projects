A library management system is software made specifically to control every aspect of a 
library. It aids librarians in maintaining a database of newly released books as well as books 
that members have borrowed and their due dates. Each and every activity in your library is 
fully automated by this system. Implementing a library management system software is the 
best approach to systematically maintain, arrange, and handle innumerable books. Records 
for libraries are kept up to date using a library management system. It keeps track of the 
numbers of books in the library, how many are issued, how many are returned or renewed, 
how many have late fines assessed, etc.
